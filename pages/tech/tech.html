        <h2>Sarah Klein - Engineer</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="bio">
        <p>Sarah Klein has been writing code since before she could legally drive (though, admittedly, not very
            <i>good</i> code).
        </p>

        <p>After a brief hiatus in order to be a teenager, she turned back to tech at the University of
            Florida, where she obtained a B.A. in Digital Arts and Sciences Engineering. During her 4+1 years of
            undergrad, she completed 3 technical internships at Microsoft. The first two internships were on Sway in
            Redmond, WA and the third was on PowerPoint in Mountain View, CA. She also had a delightful stint at
            Grooveshark before they, unfortunately, had to shut their doors.</p>

        <p>In addition to her technical internships, Sarah represented DAS on the Engineering Student Advisory Council,
            participated in the Undergraduate Scholars Program, and published <a
                href="http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00091523/00872">Point/Counterpoint - Verifying Two-Voice Species
                Counterpoint in the Style of Palestrina</a>, based on a semester spent developing a web application that
            would help undergraduate students learn basic counterpoint (and thereby saving their professors quite a few
            red pens).</p>

        <p>After university and a cross-country road trip, Sarah started at Microsoft on the IoT Core team, where she
            played with bluetooth technologies, did some soldering, and dove into data. She then hopped over to the
            Mixed Reality at Work Organization, continuing in the IoT theme, but with a few variations, including mobile
            development, firmware, and Computer Vision.</p>

        <p>After cutting her teeth at Microsoft, Sarah started at the New York Times as a web developer, but soon became
            a Go engineer with a focus on personalization. Her projects have included algorithmically optimizing the
            programming of the homepage's Science & Technology block, creating NYT's first personalized email, and quite
            a few punny internal tools.</p>

        <p>In addition to her day job (and the occasional Klein family tech support afternoon), Sarah has just begun
            onboarding to the BuyNothing mobile app, where she hopes to give back to a product that helped her find
            community during the early days of the pandemic.</p>
