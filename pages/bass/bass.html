                She studied Music Theory at the University of Florida under Kevin Casseday. During that time, she
                performed in the Symphony Orchestra, Wind Symphony, fall musicals, and anywhere else with a need for
                some low notes. She also performed with the Ocala Symphony Orchestra and could be found at many brunches
                and bars with <i>The Tramp Collection</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                After Gainesville, Sarah moved to Seattle, WA where she performed with the Seattle Philharmonic
                Orchestra and the opera/bolero ensemble <i>Encanto</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since moving to NYC, Sarah has performed symphonic repertoire with the New York Repertory Orchestra and
                the Brooklyn Conservatory Orchestra, jammed some country chords on a Red Hook barge in celebration of
                the Schooner Apollonia, and spent a wonderful evening performing Annie Bacon's <i>The Folk Opera</i>, to
                Beacon's finest fireflies. She can be found at any number of jazz and bluegrass jams around Brooklyn.
