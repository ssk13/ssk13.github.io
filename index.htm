						<p>
							I am a third-year student at the University of Florida, pursuing a dual degree in Digital Arts and Sciences Engineering and Music Theory. The Digital Arts and Sciences coursework will provide me with all of the fundamentals of a traditional Computer Science degree, but with additional classes that allow me to explore the intersection of the arts and technology - and not just in the form of video game design. Students in the DAS program have the opportunity to more closely explore topics such as Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, and more. The Music Theory coursework will provide me with a fundamental knowledge of music history, pedagogy, and proficiency in my primary instrument, as well as compositional techniques and advanced musical analysis. I plan to graduate in Spring, 2017, and puruse a career in industry as a developer.
						</p>

						<p>
							While I have a true and honest passion for both music and technology, I don't anticipate that my professional happiness is contingent on a marriage of the two. My ultimate goal as a developer is to contribute to something that both fascinates me to work on and benefits others to use. If my experiences as a musician can contribute to such a product, then I'll be glad to have the skill to contribute. My study of music theory, however, is driven by my fascination with the universal influence of music, as well as my love of performing.
